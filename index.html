            The idea of a minimum income appeared for the first time in some of the various humanistic utopias of the 1500 in europe. <br> Close to the historical period of the first industrial revolution, that of the minimum income, took shape as pragmatic idea with the  proposals for "Capital grants provided at the age of majority" dating to thomas paine's agrarian justice of 1795.</span>
            <span class="col-4 SmallTextHome">The phrase "Social dividend" was commonly used as a synonym for basic income in the english-speaking world before 1986, after which the phrase "Basic income" gained widespread currency.<br>Since the first industrial revolution there was the foresight of the exponential technological envelope. At first UBI was considered a Utopy but from 1960s some experimentations had started only in the form of negative income tax; the first UBI experimentation properly took place in Canada in 1974.</span>
